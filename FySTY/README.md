# **FY**odor do**ST**oevsky's telet**Y**pe!
PuTTY plus *pointless frippery* and tremendous amounts of *bloat*[[1](#r1)][[2](#r2)][[3](#r3)][[4](#r4)][[5](#r5)][[9](#r9)]

## What is FySTY, and how is it different?

Unlike the other extant and past PuTTY forks, FySTY is meticulously
engineered such as to minimise the amount and quality of changes required
to the actual PuTTY ~~pigsty~~ ~~incoherent heap of rotten, fermenting
bat manure~~ source code, yet without sacrificing in range of features or
the quality of their implementation.  
  
This is additionally required as PuTTY's upstream is ~~an insecure, socially
inept, belligerent, obstinate, covetous arsehole~~ particularly hostile to
both users, change, reality, contributors, as well as maintainers of PuTTY
forks. As FySTY has, empirically speaking as well over the course of its
existence since late June 2018, very low maintenance cost, it is much less
likely to succumb to the inevitability of bit rot and loss of maintainers.
  
Still not convinced? Here are five (5) *extremely convincing* reasons why
you should use FySTY:  
  
1. It may or may not cause Simon Tatham to say things like "frippery" again.

2. If you do not use FySTY, **I will FUCKING MURDER YOU.**
   (peacefully, of course.)

3. FySTY has been scientifically proven to end climate change, heal minor
   cuts and abrasions, cure Vitamine D deficiency, prolong life indefinitely,
   cause climate change, usher in an era of eternal bliss and merriment beyond
   belief, and exhaustively explicate the wider purpose of Boris Johnson.
   Also, kade likes FySTY:
